# lexel
Lexel is a C library for lexing the source code of a computer languge, as well as an interface
to automatically generate a lexer based on lexing rules. Note that lexel is entirely C-based;
there's no mini-language to learn on top of the interface. Instead, lexers are generated entirely
programmatically through calls to lexel functions.
